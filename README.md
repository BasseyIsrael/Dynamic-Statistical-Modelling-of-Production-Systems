# Dynamic-Statistical-Modelling-of-Production-Systems
Here, a dynamic statistical modelling approach is developed which uses real time most recent data to continously create best fit statistical models to be used to obtain optimal values applied to decision making .This method is used in this project in petroleum production systems.
